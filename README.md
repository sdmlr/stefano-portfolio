## Overview
The portfolio website is designed to highlight my professional journey, display projects I've worked on, and demonstrate my skills in software development and design. It is a dynamic, responsive application with a clean and modern user interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Project Pages**: Each project has its own detailed page with a description, images, and technical details.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between sections.
- **Customizable Themes**: Background gradients and styles for project pages are dynamically loaded.
- **Interactive Gallery**: Projects include image galleries with modals for detailed views.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: SCSS (Sass) for modular and reusable styles
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Deployment**: Netlify
